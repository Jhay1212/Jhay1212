Hi I am Jhay Rivera, 21 years old college student here in the Philippines.
I am so in love with the programming, I would like to be able to build anything that I like with the help of technology.
I am currently learning python, css and godot for my studies and hobbies.
I am willing to collaborate and learn anything from you all <3.
You can reach me on the following social media:

- ⚡ Fun fact: I fell in love with programming because of certain youtube crackhead named Michael Reeves
